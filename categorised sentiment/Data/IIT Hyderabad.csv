"the placement is awesome and similar to other old iits, being a new iit, iith has gained lot of honor because of the work and research it produces.
All big companies such as microsoft, oracle, nvidia, salesforce, adobe, mathworks, oyo, xilinx etc visit our campus.
There was 100% placement for mtech ta in cse this year and almost every year its same.
The avg package is somewhat around 16lpa
Mtechs get a stipend of rs 12400 every month by mhourd",Swati Jaiswal,,,
"Companies come to campus in the seventh semester. Various companies like Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Honeywell, Amazon, Flipkart, etc. recruit students for various roles. The placement percentage is more than 75. The highest salary is 60 LPA. Students from Computer science, electrical, and maths n computing will have more offers compared to other departments. I do not have any plans for higher studies, want to get a good job.|Companies visit the campus to recruit interns for various roles at the start of the 5th semester. Job roles are like web developer, software developer, Analyst, Sales intern, ML developer, AI developer, etc. We can also do projects with faculty. We need to contact the faculty and tell them our project ideas, if the professor is interested he can accept and guide you. Most visiting companies are from software backgrounds only.",Akhil,,,
Placement in IIT Hyderabad is so much better than other IIT. The average package in CSE is 20 Lacs. The average package in other groups is 14 Lacs. Total 80% members are placed in every batch. I think it's the best place for coding.,Srestha Bhowmick,,,
CSE Department Placement is Excellent. All M.Tech guys placed in first 2 days. M.Tech RA avg. package is more than 22LPA. In 2019 Microsoft In.

Placement's are vee good for cse and electrical and it is very less for the other departments. Most of the companies coming for placement's are selecting the candidates who are good in coding and they are giving jobs related to marketing . Core departmental jobs are very less for mechanical and civil students. Our college provides internship opportunities. I didn't do any internship in college,Yeshwanth,,,

Unlike the other colleges it don't have any groups and disputes or regional gangs or feelings or disputes. Almost all the students in the college are well decent and their main motto is to have good knowledge on their studies. There is no racial discrimination even by the staff. The best thing is that there are no politics in the campus. If any student is found to be misbehaved or reason for any dispute he,she will be suspended for a few days which is obviously a bad remark in their conduct certificate.",Shalini,,,

"My Batch strength is 196 out of them 22 of them are girls. So Gender Ratio 22/196. Campus life is not so good as compared to other colleges, like we haven't got any bike because bikes are not allowed. Campus is around 40-50 kms off the main Hyderabad City. Ola,uber doesn't come to campus. So,there is a problem with transportation in the Medak Area. Medak is a District where IIT is located. Students from different parts of India and of different castes have come here. So,we see people of the same area being together most of the time.

The hostel rooms are very neat and the best part is the food. You love the food in hostel.Its very hygienic and they provide a very good healthy and hygienic food. There are 2 sharing rooms in hostel and as the hostel seats will be provided to all the admitted candidates. And it is mandatory to stay in their hostel as the campus is located very far from the city. Not only here most of the IITs and NITs would prefer the students to stay in their hostels. Regarding the safety of the hostel its highly secured and the lab and library are opened 24*7. So students can feel very secured as there will be continuously monitored by the security inside the campus.Food and safety wise our hostels are the best part. I can rate 10 out of 10 for both of these.,Shalini,,,

It's best with good faculty with much scope in the future. Full research initiatives done under by specialised faculties and director always will help in that.|Faculty is best in the business as far as I concerned. They were fully experienced and good academic career in their profile,Vamsi,,,
"Professors are dedicated and hard working. They all are PhDs and are working on their research areas extensively. We can approach them anytime in their office. Being a new IIT with fewer students, the faculty-student interaction is even better.",santhosh,,,

IIT Hyderabad follows what is called fractal academics under which you explore the breadth of all the subjects and then can choose to go deep in what you like. This allows us to choose our own course curriculum after 2nd year (some courses are mandatory). There is no concept of mid sem or end sem, we follow a continuous evaluation which I think is good as it doesn't burden us with the whole syllabus at once.
Students have a different curriculum according to their branches right from the first year.|One of the most promising institution with state of the art facilities. Well qualified and friendly faculty who are open to new ideas unlike older IITs with their conservative mindset. Indo-Japan collaboration makes it one of a kind attraction.",Manoj,,,
