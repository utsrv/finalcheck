"The faculty members of IIT Guwahati are quite good.
They have great knowledge about the course they teach.
They have an answer to almost every doubt of the students.
But all professors are not good, some teach very well but some do not.
They have great knowledge about the course but they are not able to explain the concepts clearly to us.
But some are quite good, they teach very well.
The course curriculum is very good but in the first year, the students have to study each and every subject, not only their stream related stuff.
Some courses are quite enjoyable but some are not.
On a daily basis, we have a tutorial, three lectures and one lab session.
They teach with the slides they bring which are prepared by the profs themselves.
Slides are very useful study material. They provide it to us after every lecture.",Shivam Kumar,,

The faculty is highly qualified. The teaching method is through PowerPoint presentations. 
We didn't have term exams. We had tests every two weeks, the total is taken and relative grading is given.
