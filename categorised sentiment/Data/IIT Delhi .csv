One of the best faculty all over India in all the department. The tentative number of lecture in a course depends on the credit of a course. If a course is of 4 credits then we have 3 lecture per week of 1 hr each and also a tutorial of 1 hr. The average age of professors is quite high indicating that they are very experienced. Most of them are graduated in one of the IITS and then further a post graduation in a foreign University. One professor take 3-4 courses and they are perfect in that. They are either researching on that particular topic or they had done their post graduation in that topic. So they teach quite well and clear every doubt we have.,Yash Jain
