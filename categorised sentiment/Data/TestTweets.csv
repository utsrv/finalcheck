Review of IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology.
There is a good infrastructure on the campus, and there are good faculty members.
It was an amazing college. The best experience, students could get in life.
There is very much to explore, so 5years at college are insufficient to utilise all its avenues.
I would recommend IIT Madras as the best destination if engineering is the passion you have.
Unparalleled college experience in India.
IIT Madras is really a good institution for engineering.
It is one of the best parts of my life, which I would cherish for a lifetime.
This place won't disappoint you, go for it.
One of the best course, very great faculty, high rate of placements every year.
Good placements, really good course structure and infrastructure, value for money, NIRF rank 1.
Absolutely satisfied by everything. But we can have more internship opportunities.
Our college is very good and has great placements.
I am proud to study at IITM.
Our college provides great opportunities, but the hostel life is not that good.
The lectures are very involving & thought-provoking. There is no curfew in hostels.
