"Worst among all the IITs, characterless, rude, unethical, all the works to be performed by teaching assistants which are research scholars. Institute lacks faculty and research scholars have to perform all the academic tasks of guide as well as teaching supervisor.",Anand Kumar,,,,,,,
If you compare the faculties of IIT Mandi with other IITs then it is average. Most of the professors did their PhD from good universities of world. IIT Mandi has lot's of young assistant professors. Also some of the professors are from older IITs and very experienced.,Sakshama Ghoslya,,,,,,,
College has a very good faculty profile in almost all the areas where research experience is long and valuable. This provides students to work in various areas and integrates findings in various fields for better outputs.,Anand Kumar,,,,,,,
Faculty for branches except Mech was good. Luckily we got some visiting faculty from other IITs but that was not enough. Only 1 or 2 permanent faculty in Mech is good.,Knav,,,,,,,
Faculty quality cannot be generalized as all types of teachers are there. There are a good number of professors who are retired and ready to build a new institute.,Anil Kumar,,,,,,,
