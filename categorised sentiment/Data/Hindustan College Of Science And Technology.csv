The are equipment with the essentials and the hostellers live in harmony.,Charu SaxenaI would say 50 percent of teachers were really good. 20 percent average and 30 percent were just there for namesake as they were not good enough for teaching and often goofed up on subjects. This led to disbelief on teachers and their methods. So you kind of lose faith in their teaching.,
There is a 7 lectures in a day and each lecture is about 50 min. Teachers came and start teaching us without wasting any time they are proffessional so they can only focus on the teaching.they took practicals also and maintain a proper graph of the topics.,Robins yadav,

At my time 2015-19 faculty was nice but not good they give you knowledge about things which they know but now when scenario is change I guess we need little moderation too. But faculty was not ready for that. They don't give you answers for your out of the box question and even they can tell you to just concentrate on studies only. But I can't say this for all faculty some were good enough to make you think differently and on all aspects.,Janvi Daryani,

"The faculty is qualified but lack in experience. Interaction is good. They lack in giving practical knowledge. But there is no shortage of faculty. They also provide notes if required. The things that should be improved are as follows:
1. practical knowledge,
2. Interesting way of teaching,
3. More field knowledge should be provided to the student so they can apply in their studies. 
4. The industrial knowledge is also be given by faculties.
If the above things are improved the teaching is much better and students also take interest and the bunking of the class can be reduced. And this overall increase the grades of the students. This helps the students in the interview.
