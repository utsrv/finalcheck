"IIT Palakkad was established in 2015, therefore only in the last year did the placements begin. Yet, the campus placement has been a huge success. Many high-end companies like Mathworks, HSBC, Arista Networks, Fourkites visited the campus to recruit students. Highest salary offered was 16.75 Lakhs per annum. It is highly competitive. Almost all the students get internships from the college with a stipend between Rs.14,000- 20,000. The job as well as the internship placements are conducted through Career Development Centre (CDC) in the college. Since I am only approaching my third year, I haven't yet taken any internships.",Anand,,,,,,,

There is no other specific or particular reason behind it. One advantage I have considered is the environment it is situated in. This college is in Kerala", and this state is also kind of near to my home state. Negative aspect is that it is one of the newly established IITs. At the time I joined the college, there was not a single batch that passed out. So I was not sure about the placements. But I don't regret my decision of joining this college. The faculty is good and even the placements and internships are also good. However the infrastructure and the facilities are not like those of old IITs. These are still under development. But as of now the facilities are good.,,,,,
