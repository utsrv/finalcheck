"The course curriculum of my department is best and the faculty members are kind enough. They have good subject knowledge and also give us proper guidance timely about career opportunities and other opportunities as well.
if we see the student-faculty ratio then it is almost 1:50 means every 50 students at IIT KGP have 1 faculty member. faculty members are highly educated and master in their respective subject in theory, as well as practical and also a good sense of teaching all, are highly experienced in teaching.
in the offline semester, there are 2 main exams(mid-term and end-term) along with these 2 major tests,s and sometimes some surprise tests also be there.
Tests and exams are quite easy if we listen to all the lectures carefully then it's very easy to get higher marks.",Rahul Kumawat,
"Most people try to get into courses like computer science, mathematics and computing, electronics and telecommunication, electrical. But you require a decent rank for these courses. If you fail to get a decent rank you may have to compromise with your dream branch. Though none of the branches is lower people decide on a decent branch and a lower branch according to the placements of that particular branch. Professors teaching at IIT Kharagpur are very well qualified, most of them had done PhD in their particular subjects. Though you won't get school feeding here. But many of the professors will encourage practical knowledge. The professors are very punctual and the curriculum also.",Kshitija Bobade,
"I chose this course because I want to be a civil servant and civil engineering is especially for such mindset people.
The faculty to student ratio is not so good. Almost 180 students are taught by a single faculty in this online semester.
The teaching method and dedication to the teaching of the professors is impressive. The faculty is well qualified.
The exams are taken quite often. We are having almost 2 to 3 assignment a week plus test are also taken weekly and to pass them is quite difficult.",Suraj meena,
"Since I wanted to do food engineering and only one IIT i.e. IIT Kharagpur has this course, so I went for it.
There are about 500 professors in IIT Kharagpur with more than 4 years of experience and there are around 10000 UG students so the faculty: student ratio for UG students is nearly 1:14.
Some faculties do not interact with students much so there is a communication gap. Also, there is a large strength of students in one section which decreases the one-to-one interaction between professors and students decreases.
Faculties are highly qualified and expert in their fields, although some students are not able to understand from their teaching methods and they study on their own.
My online semester started from 1st December, 2020 and the end semester examinations got finished by 12th march, so a usual 4.5 month semester was completed in 3.5 months.
Since navigation between questions wasn't allowed in the exams, it was highly difficult to pass.",Aryan Bordia,
"I chose metallurgical department because famous alumina of IIT Kharagpur was from this department.
Pros: 
Maximum faculty members are PhD from reputed university. They are extremely knowledgeable and they clarify our doubts .
Cons:
        The teaching of maximum professors is not so interesting .There is lot of pressure of academics including numerous test ,assignment and quizzes.",Student (Anonymous),
"Now the fire technology is the growing sector of ENGINEERING. Nowadays if we have to deal with the changing Atmosphere then we have to put our engineering knowledge with the help of the biological knowledge

All the facilities here are qualified with post-doctoral degree
The term exams and results are very timely here and it's quite difficult to pass the test if you aren't that much attentive in the class.",Arghya GHOSH,
"I have chosen this course as it has good ROI and also had an interest in the HR Domain. Faculty are highly qualified and have Industry Exposure, so the Course pedology is as per to Industry.
we have two-semester in a year so exam is conducted through case studies, class participation, and final term exam",Mili Jain,
Faculties are great. Most of them are IIT alumni and have completed their PhDs from universities like the University of California and other great universities. Exams are not that hard to pass if you really concentrate on the classes.,Student (Anonymous),
"Particularly for Mechanical Engineering, the student to faculty ratio is good. typically, we have around 180 students in a single year's batch for mechanical engineering. Teaching is a mix of theory as well as practical courses. The subjects like Heat transfer, IC Engines, Mechanics of solids are very interesting. The subjects are easy to handle given you prepare for them at least a week before exams.",Yash Verdhan Lakhotia,
"Not very updated but some courses are highly interesting. Also we have courses with EC, EE & CS as well so the development is wholesome and allows for a lot of options in circuital. Pursuing is also easy and the peers make an even better place.",Student (Anonymous),

"The course designed in a way that every student gets to student subject from every domain in 1st year including subjects from CSE, ECE so that students gets to know about every subject and subsequently in 2nd year moves to domain specific subjects and I guess in 3rd year we have to choose the specialization.Faculties members are extremely knowledgeable and talented. Most of them are experts in research fields",Student (Anonymous),
"My program fee was 156000 annually, the modes of payment accepted by the college are physical payment through challan, net banking, debit card, and loan payment. There is no additional fee required to get admission into this college and course. The college does provide transparency in the fee breakdown.|This curriculum majorly deals with the optimisation of the supply chain, production processes, and inventory systems. In the first and second years, we learn a lot of different subjects namely: physics1, chemistry 1, mathematics1, mathematics2, bio, environmental studies, electronics, electrical, mechanics, etc. This course does provide industry-specific knowledge for students who want to go for core jobs. No industry visits were organized by the college for students but 4 credits were allotted for any industrial internship.",Rahul Jangid,
"I always was interested in Physics, looking up at the night sky and talking to the stars (no I am not a psychopath, I just happen to personify the burning balls of fire and like having one-sided conversations with them.). This sparked my curiosity about why, how, and when the universe started. Hence, Masters of Science, Department of Physics became my home for the next five years.
The faculty-student ratio is pretty appreciable, we have around 40-50 professors and about 200 students (including all five batches) in our Department.
All the faculties are Doctorate holders in their own specific area of interests which range from Optics to Particle physics.
We have a Mid-term exam and an End-term exam with small tests sprinkled throughout the semesters. there are lab tests that are easy mostly. the theory exams have mixed questions keeping in mind the hard-working as well as the talented population of our department. The frequency is mostly uniform with a couple of class tests per semester.",Student (Anonymous),
"Fees should be paid semester-wise within the due date. Payment is online through ERP. Fees depend on the course. For PhD, it is around 35, 000 per semester including mess charges. It includes tution fees, mess charge, internet, water, electricity, movie, gym, library, etc. It is much higher for BTech and MTech because of high tution fees. Several scholarships are available for underprivileged students. A loan facility is also available.|UG and PG students need to take 2-3 mandatory subjects based on his/her department. Few other subjects are also required to take in each semester from the interdisciplinary areas. Additionally, there are training, visits, internships, short-term courses, projects, etc.",Suman Saha,
"Fee structure is feasible with easily available scholar loan from the SBI branch locatd in campus. Fee structure is based on the annual family income, which is declared by each student at the start of academic session. Institute accepts online payments and challan payments both. No, admission is strictly based on JoSAA merit list. Fee breakdown in completly transparent and accessible to all.|Course curriculum is little old but it is necessary because for learning new things we need strong basic background in our subjects. Curriculum is not specifically industry based, it is very basic but some subjects have industry specific detailing in the end of the course. The alignment of course towards industry or research background mostly depends on respective professors. Curriculum is very aptly suited for securing campus placements, some companies ask questions directly from the lecture notes of the professors. No industrial visits for students was organised.",Gautam Jha,
"Feasible at our point of time, though there has been a recent trend in increase of fees. Since the admission is strictly based on JEE, no donations or additional charges are there. Overall 4.5 Lakh was my total cost incurred on course and hostel fees|For the first two years, most of the courses and subjects are very academic in nature with more focus on building the theoretical knowledge and gaining the competitive edge across a huge batch of students. However, in my course since the beginning of 3rd year a lot of courses were revamped keeping in view the current industry requirements. Many industry connects were planned, students started collaborating with professors on real-world projects. At the end of 3rd year, there is a compulsory internship (industry/ research) which gives a lot of insights and brings students closer to what actually goes in industry.",Saket Shubham,
"As per government norm IIT charge tution fee. So, no one can bargain about it. I believe annual tution fee for graduate students is arround 2 lakhs, for post graduate students is around 1 lakh, and for Phd students is around 20 thousands. However, the fee for hostels is little bit higher than expected.|You have to do a compulsory course work (atleast 4 subjects including English) -Along with course works you have to appear a comprehensive exam (written).

The fee structure is divided into Tution dee and hostel and mess fee. if one cannot afford the fee there are many scholarship given by the college which allows the removal1of tution fee which is around 1 lakh rupee per semester therefor the fee structure is very affordable. The entire process of paying the fees is done online. Through the erp website of my college.|The course is research drven are the faculty are also very knowledgeable in the subject they teach which makes learning it more interesting and not boring. The labs are also well maintained and have many equipment for demonstration of varuous process which are conducted in the factory.

"The course syllabus is well up to date and includes topics one would study for data science profile. Also including economics course and the option for breadths, this course provides one to pursue any field of interest from mathematics to economics.",Karan Uppal,
"It is a government institute, so depending on your family income, you have to different fees, and it is affordable but not very cheap. Yes the fees structure is very transparent. And no additional donations are required to get into college, the entrance exam is the only way to get into the college. Also if your income is less than 1lpa then there is no tution fee for you. There is a MCM scholarship. And also easily accessible student loan.|The course structure is very good, the exam pattern is application oriented, making us bettter engineers, the professor community is research oriented and heavily involves students thus embodying a drive towards research. The student community focus a lot towards learning the industry specific skills thus the placement statics are very good.",Tushar Patle,
"It is feasible with a number of provisions for people from weaker economic sections (for whom the tuition fee is waived off and only hostel fee of 70k is charged per year) and for others there are incredible 0 interest loan schemes. Even apart from this a yearly expense of 270000 is less than most other engineering colleges with accomodation.|Course curriculum is somewhat relevant. The exam structure is simple 50% end semester exams, 30% mid semester exams and 20% professor's evaluation. Though majority of the grading is done on the basis of how much of an impression a student has on his/her professor, it is not very difficult to score. Regular attendance is the most powerful tool to put a long lasting positive impression on a professor of IIT KGP. Industry specific knowledge is imparted in the final years while there is very limited useful subjects in the first two years. Industrial visits are not organized by the department though there is a compulsory industrial training or internship in the pre-final year.",Upamanyu Chatterjee,
"The fees is reasonable with the facilities provided to the students. Th subsidized mess food, gymkhana fees and medical insurance are some basic facilities available with in the fees.

So, no corruption and over head charges.|The Ph.D course started with the course work Usually, tge supervisor recommend the subjects to be taken during the coursework. The classes were to be taken along with the students of B.tech and M.Tech. So, there is lot to learn from the clssroom interaction. The professors were well trained and of very deep knowledge. The subjects were taught with the perspective of both research and industry oriented Every, minor aspect kf any phenomenon is taken into consideration during the teaching. The elaborate and deep knowledge of any process makes it easy to understand and through this its easy to apply the theoretical knowledge in the professional life",Abhishek Sharma,
"The course curriculum was very intricately designed and the major focus was on learning of concepts and problem solving. We had open book exams which meant that if you had not understood the concept, you wouldn't be able to solve it. We had many industrial visits to the plants in haldia among other places. Industry experience was however intensive in our internships which was mandatory in third year and upto you if you wanted to do it in your first or second year. The faculties were very renowned and great researchers along with being really good teachers. One of the most impactful professors was sunando dasgupta who taught mass transfer and transport phenomenon. Rabibrata mukherjee was another such professor who taught us nanotechnology.",Student (Anonymous),
The course curriculum was not updated to the industry standard. It was more theoritical than practical implementation. Only few of the faculty members were strong with their subjects in terms of knowledge and experience.,Student (Anonymous),
"The course syllabus is, disappointingly, outdated and not up to current industrial standards or requirements. Basic engineering softwares like Matlab, CAD, Ansys, Comsol, etc. need to be included in the curriculum, as they find much more frequent use in industries as well as research projects. Surprisingly, NO industrial exposure was provided during the entire 4 years, apart from voluntary industrial internships opted by the students in their vacations by themselves. The department really lacked big time in this matter. Other departments in IIT Kharagpur have provided timely industrial exposure. The faculty of the department are good, and well-versed in their subjects. Not all of them are very inspiring as teachers, but mostly all of them provide you enough to create a decent understanding of the subject. Some faculties worthy of mention for their effective notes and teaching skills are Prof. Jeevanjyoti Chakraborty(Fluid Mechanics), Prof. Atul Jain(Mechanics of Solids), Prof. Saumitra Paul(Machine Tools and Machining), and Prof. Ghosh-Moulic(Applied Thermofluids)",Student (Anonymous),
"College Syllabus was not updated since 1990s, mostly C programming is still followed in the first year. And the syllabus for mechanical subjects is also conventional, manual drawings is practised instead of CAD and 3D modelling. Mostly the lecture model is Professor reading ppt material in class but a few proffesors are really dedicated and make the class lively. Prof Partha Pratim Chakroborty's class on Artificial Intelligence is a really enjoyable one. Prof Anandroop Bhattacharya's class on Heat Transfer was fabulous and conceptually enlightening. Business and Finance courses from VGSOM as optionals are also quite interesting.",Student (Anonymous),
"In case of fees institute is very accurate and precised, even late fine of Rs200/day is also followed strictly, no Mercy with fees is tolerated ( so dont take it for granted)
Some of my mates are due with the fine of 50k to 2 lakh fee breakdown and structure is mentioned clearly on the official website

Kharagpur doesn't have much outside of IIT kharagpur so students usually chose to stay in the hostel. The hostel has excellent wifi connection. The rooms are a bit old as the hostels are since 1950's, but they are decent to live in. It depends on your year, and the hostel you live in that you will get a single, double or triple shared accommodation. The hostel fees are very minimal",Student (Anonymous),
"Hostel facilities are provided for all students as it a residential college complex, also it is mandatory for all students to stay in hostels.

Each hostel in the college has different infrastructure but most of the rooms are triple occupied and there are wings of twelve rooms which have two Lavatories(washrooms). There are security guards all around the corners and every time of day to protect from any mishappening. You are allowed to go out of hostel any time but have to inform wardon if you are going out of the campus in case of any emergency. The mess staff is very cooperative although the food quality is not very good just like any hostel. We don't call them hostels, here it is a culture to refer to them as halls of residence. Mine is Lal Bahadur Shashtri Hall of Residence ( or simply LBS Hall).",Sahil Bairagi,

"The place in which the college is located is a big negative point but the vast 2200 acre campus and all the facilities available inside it more than make up for that single negative point.

"Campus Life is very awesome in IIT KGP. Firstly you will get some awesome lifelong friends. The Gender ratio is not good in IITs , it is 1:10(Girls/Boys) at my time. There are cultural societies in which everybody will participate actively. A lot of technical workshops happens every year. The ragging is banned here so no worries at all.",Abhishu,
"Campus life- While in other IITs, students would be fascinated by the city; here, the residents of Kharagpur are fascinated by IIT. IIT Kharagpur is an island in itself with all happenings, all possible places where one could hang out, chill, roam, play, and practically do anything is within the campus. KGP transforms into a micro-nation where some brainy folks are captured and left to live five years of their lives. You naturally get a sense of belonging and pride to be here. Gender ratio- 1:10 I guess. One girl for every ten boys. :P And that's something boys aren't too much happy about. XD You will remember your first day in Hall OP, the long advice your senior gave over the mess table. Maybe how you and your friends came up with a brilliant new start-up idea, the days when you planned a birthday surprise for your friend by the lakeside, the times when you got admitted in BC Roy to fake a medical leave, the first day you go all drunk on the roof-top, the 2.2 round on that cold winter night with your girlfriend, the first time you flunked and your friends cheered you up, the times when you headbanged over the rock performance at SF, or the times you spent in group study with friends in muggu room and ensured nobody studied, the CS tournament over LAN, the elaborate jali made for Illu, the long races on Khoj, the Hang-ons everywhere, the GymK Elections, the Hall Day mess and the mess in mess, the NSS Camp and the Fancy Dress Event on Farewell, the Inter-IIT thrill, the torn shirts in Holi, the new Film in Netaji, the first Department Trip, overnight snacks at Chhedis, the first party at Flavors, wow, the list goes endlessly! These memories tie you up. And these are made every single day here.",Abhishek Kumar,
"Campus life : One of the best. Quite lenient. Unlike private colleges where students are locked in their hostels after classes, we have so many societies, so many opportunities to make friends and interact with seniors after class hours. Gender Ratio: 10:1. Sports: We have well developed infrastructure for every kind of sports. Every hostel has its own volleyball, hockey, cricket, badminton court, table tennis. In addition, there's a common tennis court, swimming pool and two large playgrounds, for football, hockey and cricket practice. Throughout the year, these fields are swarmed with students practicing for various sports events organised by Gymkhana like Open IITs, Inter IITs and regional championships. Societies: A lot of societies are registered under gymkhana with aim of bringing like minded people together to make something which individuals cant achieve alone. Some of them are : Business clubs, Music club(Eastern & Western), Dramatics clubs, Robotics club, Literary clubs, student run youth welfare society (NGO), entrepreneurship cell, Debating society, Quiz club, Alumni relations cell etc. These societies have a well defined hierarchy which helps them carry out operations quite efficiently. They hone the skills of their members by encouraging them to practice and participate in various national international events, many-a-times members pass with flying colours.",Rathin Kumar,
"Campus life is awesome and sometimes overwhelming despite the hectic and stressful schedule. Extracurricular activities are organized around the year and are managed by respective committees. An annual Inter IIT meet is organized every year in December which is hosted in any IIT. Several inter-departmental sports competition are held which mostly includes cricket, football, basketball, volleyball, tennis, etc. Also, inter-hall (hostels) competitions are organized. Gender ratio is about 1:2 (female:male). Campus life is very tolerant regarding sexual orientation, race, religion, politics and economic status.|Life in IIT Kharagpur is beyond documentation and has its own charm. Kharagpur in itself does not have many amenities in terms of recreation and we have embraced it with love and warmth. The green campus with orange streetlights in night provides a vintage 1960s movie look and is beautiful. Overall, I would say despite every stressful situation, life at IIT Kharagpur campus is worth it.",Tandra Mohanta,

"A major component of the awesomeness of campus life comes from the interaction between people within the campus. The location of the campus is important, of course and makes a difference no doubt. But I doubt its a large difference. At most, what you can do if you are in(or close to) some city is go for a movie or roam around the malls. There is nothing else you can do at a city.",RishabhI don't have much idea about placements right now but the placement ratio is good as per the articles published by the student's media body of the college.
